 In addition to that, I am not responsible for the actions of any individual that uses the code from my project. This project is meant to be a proof of concept of a mobile hacking platform built on a raspberry pi, and is strictly meant for educational purposes.

 This is the repository for my senior capstone project at Grand Canyon University.
 
 The goal of this project is to bring the penetration testing capabilities of a kali linux device to a mobile platform. I plan to accomplish this by using a raspberry pi w/ an easy to use flask web interface. Just like in the game Watch_Dogs, I want to make it easy to hack a network with nothing more than what you can easily carry on your body.
 
 I will be publishing all my work, including my setup scripts, testing scripts, and anything else I work on in the next semester.
 
 As I work on the project, I will be creating instructions on how to install and use my project below.
