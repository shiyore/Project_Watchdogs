# Project_Watchdogs
 This is the repository for my senior capstone project at Grand Canyon University.
 
 The goal of this project is to bring the penetration testing capabilities of a kali linux device to a mobile platform. I plan to accomplish this by using a raspberry pi w/ an easy to use flask web interface. Just like in the game Watch_Dogs, I want to make it easy to hack a network with nothing more than what you can easily carry on your body.
 
 I will be publishing all my work, including my setup scripts, testing scripts, and anything else I work on in the next semester.
 
 As I work on the project, I will be creating instructions on how to install and use my project below.
